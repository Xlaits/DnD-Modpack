# Dungeons and Minecraft

A pack carefully curated and tested to bring a Dungeons & Dragons feel to the world of Minecraft! This was created for 1.7.10, and will require Forge Mod Loader. I will see what I can do about moving the pack up, depending on what is available for newer versions, but I promise nothing.

## Installation

Once the zip is downloaded, load up a Forge Mod Loader instance for the Latest FML. You can do this how you prefer, but I will include my method of doing it. 

```
1. Open the Minecraft Launcher.
2. Go to Launch Options.
3. Click '+ Add New'.
4. Choose the FML version required.
5. Click the slider next to "Game Directory."
6. Click "Browse" nest to "Game Directory."
7. Make a new folder for all your instances. I called mine 'instances'.
8. Inside your instance folder, make a folder for that modpack/instance.
9. Select that folder, and click "OK."
10. Save your options!
11. ...
12. Profit!
```

Once that is done, place all files inside this zip inside the 'mods' folder of that instance. I will also, eventually, be including some optional but recommended configutation files, which will be placed in a different folder. This will change how this pack is structured, but will not break any functionality. If you wish to use this as a server, install it into the server's mod folder as well.
